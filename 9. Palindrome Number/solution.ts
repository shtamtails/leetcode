/* 
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
